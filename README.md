# Forward Diffusion Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the forward diffusion process by adding Gaussian noise to MNIST images across multiple time steps. The final images illustrate how a clean image transitions into noise.

## Folder Structure
- `data/`: Stores the MNIST dataset.
- `scripts/`: Contains the main code (`forward_diffusion.py`).
- `results/`: Stores generated noisy images at various steps.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python packages.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

To run the main script  : `python scripts/forward_diffusion.py`
